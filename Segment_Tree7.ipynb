        "Jack lives in the tri state area which is notorious for robberies. So as a responsible citizen of his community he has set up N baits to catch the robbers . The bait is in the form of a house containing a certain amount of money. His local community however do not have consistent funds and do not regularly supply him with money for the baits. Also , they are scared that the robbers will steal their money so they want their money back sometimes. Initially all the houses have some amount of money which will be given . Three types of events can happen :\n",
        "1 x y z : The community gives Z amount of money for each house from house x to house y to   set up baits\n",
        "2 x y z: The community takes away Z amount of money from each house from house x to house y as they are scared they will lose their money. If amount of money in each house is less than Z all the money is taken away from that house and itâ€™ll become 0.\n",
        "3 x y : Jack wants to know what is the sum of the money from house x to house y. \n",
